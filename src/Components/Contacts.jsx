        Chapter Twelve – Alice's Evidence: Alice is then called up as a witness.
        She accidentally knocks over the jury box with the animals inside them
        and the King orders the animals be placed back into their seats before
        the trial continues. The King and Queen order Alice to be gone, citing
        Rule 42 ("All persons more than a mile high to leave the court"), but
        Alice disputes their judgement and refuses to leave. She argues with the
        King and Queen of Hearts over the ridiculous proceedings, eventually
        refusing to hold her tongue, only to say, "It's not that I was the one
        who stole the tarts in the first place", in the process. Finally, the
        Queen confirms that Alice was the culprit responsible of stealing the
        tarts after all (which automatically pardons the Knave of Hearts of his
        charges), and shouts, "Off with her head!", but Alice is unafraid,
        calling them just a pack of cards; although Alice holds her own for a
        time, the card guards soon gang up and start to swarm all over her.
        Alice's sister wakes her up from a dream, brushing what turns out to be
        some leaves and not a shower of playing cards from Alice's face. Alice
        leaves her sister on the bank to imagine all the curious happenings for
        herself.

        Chapter Ten – Lobster Quadrille: The Mock Turtle and the Gryphon dance
        to the Lobster Quadrille, while Alice recites (rather incorrectly) "'Tis
        the Voice of the Lobster". The Mock Turtle sings them "Beautiful Soup"
        during which the Gryphon drags Alice away for an impending trial.

        Chapter Seven – A Mad Tea-Party: Alice becomes a guest at a "mad" tea
        party along with the March Hare, the Hatter, and a very tired Dormouse,
        who falls asleep frequently only to be violently awakened moments later
        by the March Hare and the Hatter. The characters give Alice many riddles
        and stories, including the famous "why is a raven like a writing desk?."
        The Hatter reveals that they have tea all day because Time has punished
        him by eternally standing still at 6 PM (tea time). Alice becomes
        insulted and tired of being bombarded with riddles and she leaves
        claiming that it was the stupidest tea party that she had ever been to.
