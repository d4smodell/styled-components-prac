      <p>
        Alice's Adventures in Wonderland was published in 1865, three years
        after Charles Lutwidge Dodgson and the Reverend Robinson Duckworth, on 4
        July, rowed up the Isis river (UK) in a boat with three young girlsâ€”a
        day known as the "golden afternoon"
      </p>
      <p>
        He would begin writing the manuscript of the story the next day,
        although that earliest version is lost to history. The girls and Dodgson
        took another boat trip a month later when he elaborated the plot to the
        story of Alice, and in November he began working on the manuscript in
        earnest.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before Alice received her copy, Dodgson was already preparing it for
        publication and expanding the 15,500-word original to 27,500 words,
        most notably adding the episodes about the Cheshire Cat and the Mad Tea
        Party.
